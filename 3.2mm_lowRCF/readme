These parts are for a 3D-printable centrifugal packing device for transferring sample from an ultracentrifuge tube into a 3.2 mm Bruker rotor, standard wall thickness.

The collar and cap pieces for the ultracentrifuge tube can be found in /general_accessories/

It would likely work with thin-walled 3.2 mm rotors as well, but it has not been tested with them.
